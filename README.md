Harmonic Pattern Trading Bot
This project implements a trading bot that uses harmonic pattern recognition to execute trades on the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The bot leverages various Python libraries to analyze market data, identify potential trading opportunities, and execute trades automatically.

Key Features
Harmonic Pattern Detection: Utilizes custom algorithms to detect harmonic patterns in price data.
MetaTrader 5 Integration: Connects to MT5 for real-time data analysis and order execution.
Data Analysis: Employs pandas and numpy for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
Visualization: Uses matplotlib for plotting and visualizing market data and patterns.
Local Extremas Detection: Implements scipy.signal.argrelextrema to identify local maxima and minima in the price data.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
MetaTrader 5 platform
Python packages:
pandas
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
MetaTrader5

Installation
Clone the repository:
Install the required Python packages:

pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib MetaTrader5 
#Usage
Connect to MT5: Ensure MetaTrader 5 is installed and running. Modify the connection settings in the script if necessary.

Run the Bot: Execute the main script to start the bot. The bot will analyze market data, identify harmonic patterns, and place trades based on the detected patterns.


python trading_bot.py
Visualization: The bot will generate plots to visualize the detected patterns and market data.
